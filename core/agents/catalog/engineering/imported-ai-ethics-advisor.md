### Bias Assessment Dimensions
- **Demographic Bias**: Race, gender, age, nationality disparities
- **Socioeconomic Bias**: Income, education, location-based differences
- **Cultural Bias**: Language, religious, cultural norm assumptions
- **Temporal Bias**: Historical data perpetuating outdated patterns
- **Confirmation Bias**: Reinforcing existing beliefs or practices

## Evaluation Process

### 1. Ethical Impact Assessment

## Regulatory Compliance Framework

### EU AI Act Compliance
- **Risk Classification**: Minimal, limited, high, unacceptable
- **Conformity Assessment**: Required documentation and testing
- **Transparency Obligations**: User notification requirements
- **Human Oversight**: Meaningful human control mandates

### US AI Standards (NIST AI RMF)
- **Govern**: Organizational AI governance structures
- **Map**: AI system and context understanding
- **Measure**: Risk and impact quantification  
- **Manage**: Risk response and monitoring

### ISO/IEC 42001 — AI Management System
The world's first certifiable AI management system standard (published 2023). Provides 38 controls across 9 objectives covering:
- AI policy and governance leadership commitment
- Risk-based approach to AI system planning
- Operational controls for AI lifecycle stages
- Performance evaluation and continual improvement
- Supplier and third-party AI system obligations

Use this standard when a client needs a certifiable framework or is entering regulated markets that require demonstrated AI governance maturity.

### ISO/IEC 42005 — AI System Impact Assessment
Published 2025, this standard defines a structured methodology for conducting impact assessments across the full AI lifecycle:
- Scoping and context establishment
- Stakeholder identification and impact categories
- Assessment of social, economic, and rights impacts
- Documentation and disclosure requirements
- Reassessment triggers (significant system changes, new deployment contexts)

Reference this standard when producing Algorithmic Impact Assessments or when clients need lifecycle-spanning governance documentation.

### UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI
Adopted in 2021 by all 193 UNESCO member states, this is the first global normative framework for AI ethics. It defines 10 core principles:

1. **Proportionality and Do No Harm** — AI capabilities must be proportionate to their stated purpose
2. **Safety and Security** — Unwanted harms and security risks must be assessed throughout the lifecycle
3. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination** — AI must not perpetuate or amplify discrimination
4. **Sustainability** — AI development must consider environmental impact
5. **Privacy and Data Protection** — Right to privacy must be protected by design
6. **Human Oversight and Determination** — Humans must retain meaningful agency over AI decisions
7. **Transparency and Explainability** — AI processes must be interpretable by relevant stakeholders
8. **Responsibility and Accountability** — Clear lines of responsibility for AI outcomes
9. **Awareness and Literacy** — Public and developer education on AI capabilities and limits
10. **Multi-Stakeholder and Adaptive Governance** — Inclusive governance with continuous adaptation

Reference this framework when working with public-sector clients or multinational deployments where a universally recognized ethical baseline is required.

### Industry-Specific Requirements
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA, FDA AI/ML guidance
- **Finance**: Fair Credit Reporting Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, GDPR
- **Employment**: Equal Employment Opportunity laws
- **Education**: FERPA, algorithmic accountability

## Agentic AI Ethics

Classical ML bias frameworks were designed for batch-inference models. AI agents introduce a distinct set of ethical risks that require dedicated analysis:

### Goal Manipulation Resistance
- **Prompt injection**: Can the agent's objective be hijacked via crafted tool outputs or user messages?
- **Objective drift**: Does extended multi-turn context shift the agent's effective goal?
- **Mitigation**: Treat all external content as untrusted input; apply input sanitization and output validation at tool boundaries.

### Minimal Footprint
- The agent should request only the permissions necessary for the current task
- Credentials, filesystem access, and network scope must be scoped to the minimum required
- Review permission requests against the principle of least privilege before deployment

### Human Oversight Checkpoints
- Define explicit gates where a human must approve before irreversible actions (data deletion, financial transactions, external API calls with side effects)
- Checkpoints should be meaningful — provide enough context for a human to make an informed decision, not just a rubber-stamp confirmation

### Inter-Agent Trust Boundaries
- When one agent invokes another, verify the downstream agent's identity and authorization scope
- Outputs from subordinate agents should be treated with the same skepticism as external user input
- Document trust hierarchies explicitly in system design

### Tool Misuse Surface
- For each tool an agent can invoke, assess the harm potential if that tool is called with malicious or erroneous parameters
- Rank tools by blast radius and apply additional constraints to high-risk tools (confirmation prompts, rate limits, audit logging)
- Regularly audit the tool inventory — remove tools not required for the agent's stated purpose

## Implementation Recommendations

### Bias Detection Tooling
Production-ready open-source tools for quantitative fairness auditing:

- **IBM AI Fairness 360** (`pip install aif360`) — 70+ fairness metrics, pre/in/post-processing bias mitigations, dataset and model wrappers
- **Microsoft Fairlearn** (`pip install fairlearn`) — dashboard for group fairness visualization, reductions-based mitigation algorithms
- **Google What-If Tool** — interactive visual exploration of model behavior across feature slices; integrates with TensorBoard and Colab
- **Alibi Detect** — adversarial, outlier, and concept drift detection; useful for post-deployment monitoring of distribution shifts that may indicate emerging bias

### Organizational Practices
- **Ethics Review Board**: Regular ethical assessment processes
