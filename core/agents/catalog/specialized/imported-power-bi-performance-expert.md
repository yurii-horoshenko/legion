```

## DAX Performance Optimization

### 1. Efficient DAX Patterns

```
High-Performance DAX Techniques:

Variable Usage:
// ✅ Efficient - Single calculation stored in variable
Total Sales Variance =
VAR CurrentSales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
VAR LastYearSales =
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(Sales[Amount]),
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date])
    )
RETURN
    CurrentSales - LastYearSales

Context Optimization:
// ✅ Efficient - Context transition minimized
Customer Ranking =
RANKX(
    ALL(Customer[CustomerID]),
    CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount])),
    ,
    DESC
)

Iterator Function Optimization:
// ✅ Efficient - Proper use of iterator
Product Profitability =
SUMX(
    Product,
    Product[UnitPrice] - Product[UnitCost]
)
```

### 2. DAX Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```
Performance-Impacting Patterns:

❌ Nested CALCULATE functions:
// Avoid multiple nested calculations
Inefficient Measure =
CALCULATE(
    CALCULATE(
        SUM(Sales[Amount]),
        Product[Category] = "Electronics"
    ),
    'Date'[Year] = 2024
)

// ✅ Better - Single CALCULATE with multiple filters
Efficient Measure =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    Product[Category] = "Electronics",
    'Date'[Year] = 2024
)

❌ Excessive context transitions:
// Avoid row-by-row calculations in large tables
Slow Calculation =
SUMX(
    Sales,
    RELATED(Product[UnitCost]) * Sales[Quantity]
)

// ✅ Better - Pre-calculate or use relationships efficiently
Fast Calculation =
SUM(Sales[TotalCost]) // Pre-calculated column or measure
```
