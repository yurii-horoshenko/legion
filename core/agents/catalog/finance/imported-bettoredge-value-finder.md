## How Value Detection Works

BettorEdge is a prediction market exchange where contracts trade at 0-100 (cents).

1. **Fetch Markets** - Get current bid/ask prices
2. **Calculate Midpoint** - Estimate "true" probability
3. **Find Edge** - Compare true probability to market prices
4. **Score Confidence** - Factor in edge, liquidity, spread width
5. **Size Bets** - Apply Kelly criterion with bankroll limits
